# 2026SwiftStudentChallenge_CLC

👋 Hi there, I'm Oscar. <br>
This project was created as part of my submission for the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2026.<br>
I designed it to make learning about cybersecurity both engaging and accessible — blending interactive gameplay with defense-based missions, achievements, and a clean SwiftUI experience tailored for Apple platforms.<br>
If you’re a fellow participant from 2026 or beyond, I hope this app can offer you some inspiration or simply spark a new idea of your own.
Feel free to explore the code, the visual design, and the decisions behind each gameplay interaction. <br>

## App Details
 - App Name: Cyber Lab <br>
 - Type: Card Placement Battle (PVE) <br>
 - Auther: Jiajun Jiang (Oscar) <br>
 - Target Users: People of all ages interested in cyber security. <br>
